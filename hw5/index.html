        <p><span>Frida Kahlo</span>, born in 1907, was a Mexican painter known for her deeply personal and symbolic artwork. She often explored themes of identity, pain, and Mexican culture through her famous self-portraits, which reflect her physical and emotional struggles. Kahlo was severely injured in a bus accident at the age of 18, which led to lifelong health problems and numerous surgeries, influencing her art. She married renowned artist Diego Rivera in 1929, and their tumultuous relationship had a significant impact on her work. Kahlo is celebrated for her exploration of Mexican folk traditions, feminism, and her unapologetic expression of personal suffering. She passed away in 1954 at the age of 47, but her legacy continues to inspire and empower, particularly as a symbol of strength for women artists.</p>
